# University of Texas Biomedical Data Science Hub
Biomedical Data Science Hub centered at University of Texas at Austin's Dell Medical School.

## Mission
The mission of the BDS Hub is to serve Dell Medical School as a scholarly resource for collaborative application of quantitative research methods, as well as development of new such methods, in support of Dell Medical School’s missions in areas of biomedical, clinical, and population health investigation and innovation.

## Areas of Inquiry:
The _primary areas of methodological activity_ include: 
* Clinical biostatistics, including clinical trials, health services research, and population health
* Clinical research informatics
* Bioinformatics

As, _as needed:_
* Statistical genetics and genomics
* Imaging analysis and informatics

## Principles Driving the BDS Hub:
 Dell Medical School has the opportunity to rethink how health care is delivered, thus we should also rethink how data drives that process.

The BDS Hub seeks to employ and deploy data science faculty and staff geared towards collaborative scholarship, willing to invest in others’ projects via a long-term collaborative process, while seeking ways to advance their own scholarly agenda. As such, we expect to be involved soup-to-nuts: early on, from the conception of a project, all the way through the submission of the last manuscript. The goal is to work with Dell Med investigators to foster the evolution of their research careers that is mutually beneficial in terms of creative, rigorous, and funded scholarship that is well-rounded and minimizes missteps and lost time and effort. 

Key Principles:
* Ground activity in modern principles of data science
* Soup-to-nuts collaborative activity in investigations from project inception to final report, with PhD level BDS Hub members serving as Co-I, and MS level BDS Hub members serving as Biostatistician or Analyst
* Develop novel quantitative methodologies independently initiated or stimulated by collaborative work
* Foster scientific integrity for DMS research projects
* Employ state-of-the-art quantitative methods
* Leverage existing strengths on the broader UT campus
* Serve as a methodological concierge to new projects, and pipeline to methodological resources elsewhere in DMS or across UT more broadly to support such project
